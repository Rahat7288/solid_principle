/**
 * High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. 
 * Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.
 * 
 * Real life example
 * ================================
 * Imagine building a house. You wouldn't directly depend on specific materials like bricks or wood for every component. 
 * Instead, you would rely on abstract concepts like "walls" and "doors," which can be implemented using various materials
 * depending on the situation. This is similar to how DIP promotes relying on abstractions rather than concrete implementations.
